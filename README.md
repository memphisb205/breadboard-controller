# GPIO Breadboard Controller

A Raspberry Pi GPIO-based game controller built on a breadboard with push buttons, written in C.

Simulates keyboard input using the Linux uinput subsystem and autostarts at boot via a systemd service.

Designed to integrate seamlessly with RetroPie for classic gaming.

## Wiring Diagram

This diagram shows how the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins are connected to the breadboard buttons.
